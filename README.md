# Hey there! I'm Shubhangi Singh, aka @ByteWithShub

 *"Create chaos, then make it beautiful."*

I'm a curious mix of an AI engineer, poet, and a designer. Recent graduate from **Artificial Intelligence Software Development**, and currently pursuing **Business Intelligence System Infrastructure**. I'm passionate about building things that combine logic with emotion, from machine learning systems to mobile mental health apps, building brand kits and leading brand collabrations, and even my writing books!
